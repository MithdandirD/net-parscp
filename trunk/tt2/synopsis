  # You need to set first a configuration file:
      $ cat Cluster
      cluster1 = machine1 machine2 machine3
      cluster2 = machine2 machine4 machine5
      num = 193.140.101.175 193.140.101.246

  # Copy 'sourcefile' to the union of cluster1 and cluster2
  $ parpush sourcefile  cluster1+cluster2:/tmp 

  # Copy 'sourcefile' to the intersection of cluster1 and cluster2
  # i.e. to 'machine2'
  parpush sourcefile  cluster1*cluster2:/tmp 

  # Copy 'sourcefile' to the machines in cluster1 that don't belong to cluster2
  # i. e. to 'machine1', 'machine2'
  $ parpush sourcefile  cluster1-cluster2:/tmp 

  # Copies 'sourcefile' to file 'tfmachine1.txt' in 'machine1'
  # and to 'tfmachine2.txt' in 'machine2'. The macro '@=' inside
  # a path is substituted by the name of the machine
  $ parpush sourcefile  cluster1-cluster2:/tmp/tf@=.txt

  # A more complicated formula:
  $ parpush 'sourcefile'  '(cluster1+cluster2)-num:/tmp'
  # Though 'machine2' is 193.140.101.175, they aren't considered
  # equal by parpush. The file will be transferred to 'machine2'

  # Several cluster expressions may appear
  # Send 'sourcefile' to machines in cluster1 but not in cluster2 
  # and store it in /tmp. Send it to machines in cluster2 but not cluster1
  # and store it at the home directory
  $ parpush sourcefile  cluster1-cluster2:/tmp  cluster2-cluster1:
